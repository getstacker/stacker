# stacker.yaml
#
# This file specifies config options for running stacker.
# It contains the plugins to load, where to load task files,
# and plugin specific config options.


# Plugins are dependencies that register tasks or hook into stacker events.
# Syntax is similar to npm package.json "dependencies" section but as a
# sequence of objects rather than a simple hash. This guarantees plugin
# load order. Plugins must implement the stacker plugin API.
plugins:
# - plugin_name: git://url
# - plugin_name: >= 0.1

# Dependencies are npm package.json dependencies.
# List any dependencies here that are required in task files.
# Any npm module can be used.
# Dependencies and plugins are stored in ./.stacker/node_modules/
dependencies:
  shelljs: "^0.3.0"

dir: ".stacker"

# Use glob syntax for files: https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob
tasks:
  # Include dev tasks to aid in stacker release management.
